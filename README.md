## Brief About Our Project
One of the common project topics for engineering discipline students is vehicle detection in video sequence. For every beginner, this is a complicated task. Processing the frames, training the models, improving accuracy, optimizing the algorithm and hundreds of thoughts shows while choosing these type of topics. However, there is an easy way to make a detect vehicle in video sequence using object detectors.  Suppose you want to analyze the traffic patter to predict the intensity of traffic jam, the first thing you have to do is to track the vehicle from either live traffic camera or from video footage. That means you need the skill to develop a vehicle detection system. If you want to build an artificial intelligence (AI) powered automatic traffic control system, again the first step is to detect the vehicle.
